REM Listen... this script uses notepad++ to open the shortcut that probably points to the carpboard file. It's hyperoptimized for my specific use because I got tired of closing and opening (and keeping open) the file in my editor in inefficient way.
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\carpboard - Shortcut.lnk"
